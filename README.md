# Charger

Charger is a mobile app that allows users to find publicly available charging point on a map and view their location.

## How to use


## Planning

I came up with the idea of Charger when I realised there was rarely clear signage for public car charger points and on research I found no stylish and easy to use apps that would appeal to the demographic of electric car owners.

### User Stories

As an electric car owner
So I can easily find charging points relative to my location
I would like to have an app which showed a map

As an electric car owner
So I can navigate to the charging point
I would like to see a marker on the map where a charging point is
